Getting Started
===============

This document will show you how to get up and running with Read the Docs.
You will have your docs imported on Read the Docs in 5 minutes,
displayed beautifully for the world.

If you are already using Sphinx or Markdown for your docs, skip ahead to
:ref:`getting_started:Import Your Docs`.

Write Your Docs
---------------

You have two options for formatting your documentation:

* `In reStructuredText`_
* `In Markdown`_

In reStructuredText
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is `a screencast`_ that will help you get started if you prefer.

Sphinx_ is a tool that makes it easy to create beautiful documentation.
Assuming you have Python_ already, `install Sphinx`_::

    $ pip install sphinx sphinx-autobuild

Create a directory inside your project to hold your docs::

    $ cd /path/to/project
    $ mkdir docs

Run ``sphinx-quickstart`` in there::

    $ cd docs
    $ sphinx-quickstart
